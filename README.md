# Setup new MacOS computer for development with Node and Python

This readme outlines how I setup a new Apple computer for general use and for Node and Python development.  I am logging into iCloud and syncing the new computer to my account but I not setting up the new computer from an existing computer.  Instead I am setting up from scratch. 

The repo contains some shell scripts to help speed-up the process and some reference material to help clarify the steps.

If you follow these steps **sequentially without jumping around**, and trust we will cover all the major steps, it should be a fairly fast and efficient setup.


## First Steps

Lets do a couple of things that will make this whole process a bit easier.

### Download this repo

Since we haven't set up Git on your new computer you can't clone repos yet.  Instead download the **zip** of this repo to your Downloads folder.  Then move it to the root of your `User` folder.

```shell
cd ~/ && mv Downloads/macos-setup-main macos-setup
```
Now you can cd into this repo locally to run scripts in terminal.

### Install a Password Manager and MFA app

Install and configure your chosen **password manager** and your **MFA app**, if you use one.

Since you will be configuring apps, services and logging into websites you will want quick and easy access to all you passwords.

### Install Developer Tools

Installing XCode is a painfully long wait and not necessary if all you need are the **developer tools**.  To initiate installation of just the tools without installing XCode just call git

```shell
git
```

Since git is not installed you will be prompted to install developer tools (since git comes with that package.) 

Alternatively you can install XCode from the Apple store.

### Install fonts

I like [Anonymous Pro Font](https://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro) for use in VSCode and Terminal.  But I want the version with lots of icons so I [download the Anonymice Pro Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.1/AnonymousPro.zip) from [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

Double click to open the archive and click on a font variant to open FontBook. Install the font then drag the remaining variants of the font into FontBook to install them.

This might be good time to install any other fonts you like to use.  Its good to have them available for use when configuring apps later.

### Install Homebrew

We will use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install apps.  Open terminal and run the installation script

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Run any post install commands in terminal to finish the install

### Sign into YouTube

I you have a YouTube subscription, to avoid advertisng, sign in now so you can consult videos along the way to clarify anything that seems unclear.

### Set MacOS preferences

Open up System settings and starting at the top go through each item and set your preferences.  If you are starting from scratch instead of syncing up from an existing computer this may seem tedious but I like to do this upfront instead of tweaking settings as I use MacOS because it gives me chance to review what the OS offers in the way of options and I always fond something new along the way.


## Install previously purchased apps

### Install apps from Apple app store

You probably have some apps you purchased through the Apple app store.  Now is a good time to install them.  To find a list of your previously purchased apps open the app store and click on the account name.

### Copy over apps from other sources

If you have apps from your old computer or other sources now is the time to get them onto your new Mac.

### Configure your purchased apps

Open all the apps on your computer.  Sign-in if necessary and click through the startup windows so the app is ready to use the next time you open it.


## Install apps with Homebrew

Homebrew is the defacto package manager for MacOS.  Packages are app you can install on your computer.  You interact with Homebrew from the command line in terminal. An app can have several versions.  A version of an app is stored in a "cask".

### Review cask-list

Open and read the list of casks to be installed.

```shell
cd install-brew-casks && open cask-list.txt -a textedit
```
This repo contains the file `cask-list.txt` in the folder `install-brew-casks`.  Open it up and add or delete apps to install with Homebrew.  Find other interesesting apps to install with Homebrew in the file `useful-casks.csv` or Google to find out what other people are running.

### Install casks (apps) with Homebrew

We will programatically install the apps in `cask-list.txt` back to back using a script.

Run the cask install script

```bash
zsh install-casks.zsh
```

> **IMPORTANT!!!**
>
> Stick around during this process. You might need to to provide the login password for the computer during one or more of these installations.
> 
> This will take some time...  get yourself a tea...


## Configure apps installed with Homebrew

Open each app and login or set your preferences.  Add apps to the dock or the menu bar according to your preference.  


## Configure an alternative terminal

Using the default terminal app that comes with MacOS can be bit tedious.  This is how I set up iTerm2 and Warp as alternatives. 

> IMPORTANT!
> Now that we are on the subject of terminals your first instinct will be to start tweaking out the look and feel of iTerm2 or Warp or Terminal.  Resist that impulse. Just do some basic config now and wait until we start to set up Node.

### iTerm2

**Set theme**

- [ ] @ `settings > profiles > general > theme` set to "Dark"

**Install a color palette**

- [ ] go to https://iterm2colorschemes.com/ and choose colours palette
- [ ] create a file on the desktop with ext `.itermcolors`
- [ ] paste choosen color palette into file
- [ ] double click file to load colours into presets
- [ ] go to `settings > profiles > colours` and choose the preset

**Choose a font**

- [ ] @ `settings > profiles > text > font` set to "AnonymicePro Font"
- [ ] set font size to "22"

**Load new tabs and windows in previous location**

- [ ] @ `Preferences > Profiles > General > Working Directory` set to "Reuse previous sessions directory"

**Use opt + arrow to move across tokens in a text string**

- [ ] @ `Preferences > Profiles > Keys > Key Mapping > Presets` set to "Natural Text Editing"


### Warp

#### Sign into Warp

- [ ] First login to your Github account in the web browser
- [ ] Login to Warp using your GitHub account (you'll be redirected to GitHub in the Browser)

#### Configure Warp

- [ ] Choose prompt
- [ ] Choose theme
- [ ] Choose the font (use the previously installed **Anonymice Pro Mono** font)
- [ ] Set font size to "22"

#### Open This readme in Warp

You can open a markdown file in Warp, then you can execute any code blocks in the markdown by clicking on the code block. This will make moving through this readme much faster than cutting and pasting code into terminal.

```shell
cd ~/macos-setup && open README.md -a warp
```


## Setup text editors

I write and edit text using three apps.  Apple Notes for everyday productivity. Typora for markdown. And VSCode for code.  Here's how I configure them.

### VSCode

- [ ] Turn on settings sync (syncs settings with Github account)
- [ ] Turn on "linked tag editing" @ settings > linked editing

#### Install extensions

If you synched settings for VSCode from a previous install this won't be necessary.

Current Favorites:

- [ ] Just Black + comments (theme)
- [ ] Font size shortcuts
- [ ] GitHub Copilot (requires subscription)
- [ ] GitLens
- [ ] Jupyter
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Rainbow CSV
- [ ] Prettier
- [ ] Vscode icons
- [ ] live server
- [ ] vsc-nvm

Consider:

- [ ] ES7+ snippets (dsznajder)
- [ ] Vetur (for vue)
- [ ] Indent rainbow
- [ ] Todo highlight
- [ ] Version lens
- [ ] Import cost
- [ ] Debugger for chrome (and also does Firefox)
- [ ] rest client

### Typora

You can use `open -a typora xxx.md` to open the markdown file `xxx.md` in Typora from a command line. If Typora is your default editor for `.md` files, when `open xxx.md` would be enough.

You can also add
```
alias tp="open -a typora"
```
in your `.zprofile` file, then you would be able to simply type `typora xxx.md` instead.

(Requires Typora â‰¥ 1.1) If you want to use command line to not only open existing files, but also creating new files when target `.md` file does not exists, you could add
```
alias typora="/Applications/Typora.app/Contents/MacOS/Typora"
```
in your `.zprofile` or other configuration file.

Then if you run `typora xxx.md` and `xxx.md` does not exists, Typora will pop up a dialog to ask you whether to create target file or cancel the operation.



## Install Oh-My-Zsh

Oh-My-Zsh is the quickest way to get a nice terminal experiance.  Install [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

**Change the theme**

Change theme in the `.zshrc` file.  If you use iTerm2 you can choose freely from any on the available themes.  However, if you use Warp you need to choose a theme with a relatively clean prompt since Warp adds alot of formatting to the prompt and the history blocks of previously executed code.

Try: 
```shell
ZSH_THEME="af-magic"
```
or 
```shell
ZSH_THEME="half-life"
```

### Install Oh-My-Zsh plugins

**zsh-syntax-highlighting**

Setup syntax highlighting for Terminal and iTerm2 if you use them (I can't get it to work with Warp)

Follow [install directions for Oh-My-Zsh]([https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting/blob/master/INSTALL.md#oh-my-zsh))

Clone this repository in oh-my-zsh's plugins directory:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```
Activate the plugin in ~/.zshrc:
```shell
plugins=( [plugins...] zsh-syntax-highlighting)
```
Restart zsh (such as by opening a new instance of your terminal emulator).


**zsh-autosuggestions**

Follow the install for [install for Oh-My-Zsh](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions/blob/master/INSTALL.md#oh-my-zsh)

Clone this repository into `$ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins` (by default `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`)
```shell
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
```

Add the plugin to the list of plugins for Oh My Zsh to load (inside ~/.zshrc):
```shell
plugins=( 
    # other plugins...
    zsh-autosuggestions
)
```

Start a new terminal session.

## Setup Node.js

We are going to install Node using nvm so we easily manage Node versions.  We are going to install nvm as an Oh-My-Zsh plugin

**zsh-nvm**

zsh-nvm will install nvm as an Oh-My-Zsh plugin making it easy to update nvm and not mess up existing node and package installations.  In addition it will configure auto swithing the node version listed in a `.nvmrc` file if present.

Clone zsh-nvm into your custom plugins repo
```shell
git clone https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/zsh-nvm
```

export settings for zsh-nvm and load the plugin in `.zshrc`
```shell
export NVM_AUTO_USE=true
plugins+=(zsh-nvm)
```

Reload the shell (source `.zshrc`)
```shell
source .zshrc 
```

**Install two versions of node**


Install Node at version 18
```shell
nvm install 18
```
Install Node at version 16
```shell
nvm install 16
```


**Test auto-switching between Node versions**
To make sure all previous changes take effect close out your terminal shell and re-open a fresh one
```shell
mkdir one && cd one && touch .nvmrc && echo "v16" > .nvmrc
```
and 
```shell
mkdir one && cd one && touch .nvmrc && echo "v18" > .nvmrc
```
check auto switching
```shell
node --version && cd one && cd ../two && cd ../one && cd ../
```

**Install Yarn**
```shell
nvm use 18 && npm install -g yarn
```
and 
```shell
nvm use 16 && npm install -g yarn
```

**Configure NPM**

if you cd into an empty folder and run `npm init` or `yarn init` you will initiate a CLI to walk through setting up a project.  However the answers to each prompt will not be autofilled with your standard preferences.

Create an `.npmrc` file

```bash
touch .npmrc
```
and add your preferences and authorization to download from and publish to GitHub package registry.

```bash
init-author-name=Stephen Merth
init-author-email=stephen.merth@gmail.com
init-author-url=https://smerth.github.io/
init-license=MIT
email=stephen.merth@gmail.com
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=[AUTH_TOKEN_FOR_NPM_REGISTRY]
@smerth:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/smerth
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=[PAT_WITH_PERMISSIONS_FOR_GITHUB_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
//npm.pkg.github.com/smerth/:_authToken=[PAT_WITH_PERMISSIONS_FOR_GITHUB_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
always-auth=true
scripts-prepend-node-path=true
```










## Git and GitHub

We need to get up and running with:
- Git
- GitHub Git Credential Manager
- GitHub CLI
- GitHub Desktop


### Install Git

Git is installed when the developer tools are installed however I prefer to manage installs through Homebrew where possible

```bash
brew install git
```

### Install Git Credential Manager

[Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager) (GCM) is another way to store your credentials securely and connect to GitHub over HTTPS. With GCM, you don't have to manually [create and store a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token), as GCM manages authentication on your behalf, including 2FA (two-factor authentication).

```shell
brew install --cask git-credential-manager
```

The next time you clone an HTTPS URL that requires authentication, Git will prompt you to log in using a browser window. You may first be asked to authorize an OAuth app. If your account or organization requires [two-factor auth](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa), you'll also need to complete the 2FA challenge.

Once you've authenticated successfully, your credentials are stored in the macOS keychain and will be used every time you clone an HTTPS URL. Git will not require you to type your credentials in the command line again unless you change your credentials.

- [ ] clone a private repo to initiate authentication

For more information or to report issues with GCM, see the official GCM docs at "[Git Credential Manager](https://github.com/GitCredentialManager/git-credential-manager)."


### Configure git

GitHub Credential Manager should configure git however if further config is necessary use the following pattern:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
```

Global level configuration is user-specific, meaning it is applied to an operating system user. Global configuration values are stored in a file that is located in a user's home directory. `~ /.gitconfig` on unix systems

- [ ] check `.gitconfig` against this reference version

```shell
[filter "lfs"]
	process = git-lfs filter-process
	required = true
	clean = git-lfs clean -- %f
	smudge = git-lfs smudge -- %f
[user]
	name = Stephen Merth
	email = stephen.merth@gmail.com
	twitter = StephenMerth
[push]
	default = simple
	autoSetupRemote = true
[color]
	ui = auto
[core]
	pager = less -r
	autocrlf = input
	ignorecase = false	
[credential]
	helper = 
	helper = /usr/local/share/gcm-core/git-credential-manager
[init]
	defaultBranch = main
[credential "https://dev.azure.com"]
	useHttpPath = true
```


### Install GitHub CLI

[GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

[GitHub CLI tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BRAG1Kj4-Ss)

Install GitHub CLI
```bash
brew install gh
```

Authenticate GitHub CLI
```bash
gh auth login
```

- Choose to authenticate with a web browser...
- Choose https...

**Configure GitHub CLI**
Set editor to nano so you don't have to leave the terminal
```bash
gh config set editor "nano --wait"
```

### Install GitHub Desktop

[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

- [ ] install GitHub Desktop
- [ ] create a new repo so you can set the default location for local repos to `smerth/developer/github`
- [ ] publish the new repo to GitHub


## Python

[Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Anaconda

We're going to use Anaconda to setup and manage Python environments.  Anaconda comes with a big array of data science packages, use `miniconda` if all you want are python environments.

Download the [Anaconda Free Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download) and use the installer.  Don't use Homebrew to install Anaconda.  The installer offers more control over the placement of files.

Check that `.bash_profile` has been created.  Since we're running zsh, copy the conda init script from `.bash_profile` to `.zprofile`.  You can delete `.bash_profile`

Reopen Warp.  If everything worked your prompt should begin with `base` which indicated you are currently using the base python installation.


### Set up Python Environments

Now use condo to install python versions in their own environments
```bash
conda create --name py310
```

To activate this environment
```bash
conda activate py310
```

Install a specific python version in this environment
```bash
conda install python=3.10
```

To deactivate an active environment
```bash
conda deactivate
```
To view a list of environments
```shell
conda env list
```

Get help with environments
```shell
conda env --help
```

Get help with conda
```shell
conda --help
```
